# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model
This notebook is look into various Pyhton-based machine learning and data science libraries is an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting wheather someone has a heart diease or not based on their modeical attributes.

I am going to take the following approach:
1. Problem Defination
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Features
5. Modeliing
6. Experimentation

## **1. Probelm Defination**
In the given statement,
> Given clinical params about the patient, can we predict wheather they have heart desease or not.

## **2. Data**
The orifinal data came form kaggle 

## **3. Evaluation**
> If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting heart disease, we'll pursue the project.

## **Features**
This is where you get info of each feature in  `data`
